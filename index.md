## Deep Learning Drone Simulator(Deep learning and Simulation)
This project is about training a deep neural network to identify and track a target in simulation so-called “follow me”.
Applications like this are key to many fields of robotics and the very same techniques you apply here can be extended
to scenarios like advanced cruise control in autonomous vehicles or human-robot collaboration in industry.

## Search And Sample Rover(Computer Vision and Simulation)
The goal of this project is to perform autonomous navigation and mapping. 
With each new image we receive from the rover's camera, we can make decision about sending commands like throttle,
brake and steering the rover therefore it becomes autonomous.

## Robotic Perception(Computer Vision and Simulation)
This project is modeled after Amazon Robotics Challenge. Giving a robot the ability to locate an object in a cluttered
environment, pick it up and then move it to some other location is not just an interesting problem to try to solve,
it's a challenge at the forefront of the robotics industry today.

## Robotic Arm Pick and Drop(ROS and Simulation)
This project is to control a Robotic Arm with six degrees of freedom to perform pick and drop action using
Forward and Inverse Kinematics.

## Self-Driving Car Behavioral Cloning
This project is to learn more about Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks by cloning driving behavior.
A model is trained, validated and tested using Keras framework.

## Map a world with Slam and a Custom Robot(ROS and Simulation)
This project is about implementing SLAM(Simultaneous Localization and mapping) with RTAB-MAP(Real-Time Appearance-Base Mapping).
Two 2D occupancy grid and a 3D octomap is created from a simulated environment and then map with a custom robot FouliexBot.
